Description: This Monty Hall package simplifies the ability to run the monty 
    hall problem by having a number of different functions for each step of the 
    game. These functions within the package make it easier to be able to play the 
    game where the player has to make a choice between three different doors two 
    of which have goats behind them, and one door has a car behind it. While the door 
    with the car behind it is the goal in order to win the game. This package makes 
    it easier to play the game and changes could be made as desired to make a new 
    set of rules. For example, the number of doors can be adjusted to have a 
    different amount of goats and cars behind the doors. These functions are the 
    set up for every step within the game and can be adjusted to create your own 
    game based on the Monty Hall problem!
